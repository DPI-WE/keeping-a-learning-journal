# Keeping a Learning Journal üìù
In this lesson, you will learn about the importance of keeping a learning journal, commonly referred to as a "TIL blog" (Today I Learned). Maintaining a TIL blog is extremely valuable for software developers for various reasons, including clarifying and internalizing new concepts, serving as documentation, and impressing prospective employers.

## Why Keep a Learning Journal?
Keeping a learning journal offers several benefits:

- **Clarification and Internalization**: Writing about what you‚Äôre doing helps clarify and internalize the information.
- **Documentation**: The post serves as documentation for the code, which is helpful for teammates and your future self.
- **Reference**: When you need to perform the same task again in the future, your journal serves as a cheat sheet.
- **Professional Showcase**: A TIL blog looks great to prospective employers, demonstrating both your writing and technical ability.

## What is a TIL Blog?
TIL stands for "Today I Learned." TIL blogs are not meant to publish groundbreaking ideas but rather to note what you've learned each day. These posts are primarily for your future reference, but they can also be valuable to others who read them.

## Setting Up Your TIL Blog
We will use [dev.to](https://dev.to) for our blogs for now. In the future, you might consider building your own blog, which can be a great exercise.

### Sign Up for a dev.to Account:

Go to [https://dev.to/enter](http://dev.to/enter) and sign up. Signing in with GitHub is recommended to avoid creating another password.

### Start Jotting Down Notes:

Begin writing posts about what you‚Äôve learned. You can save posts as drafts if you‚Äôre not ready to share them yet. A great source of TIL blog posts are answers to questions you've asked and other discussions. To cement your learning, rewrite the answer to your question or discussion as a TIL post.

## Track Your TIL Blogs:

Keep track of everyone's TIL blogs on [news.dpi.dev](https://news.dpi.dev). Someone else might have already written the answer to your question!
